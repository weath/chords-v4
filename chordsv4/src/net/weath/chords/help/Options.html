<b>Inter-note delay</b>
<p>
  The number of milliseconds to pause between notes when playing
  a chord. Default is 250, which causes an arpeggio effect. Use
  0 if you don't want that. You can change the default by editing
  the <span style="font-family: monospace;">ChordProps.properties</span>
  file or by adding "delay=100" (for example) to the command line.

<b>Mute</b>
<p>
  Each part/voice of the MusicXML file can be independently muted
  so that you can hear a particular part or parts in isolation.
  The checkbox is checked when the part/voice is muted. Parts
  usually correspond to staves, and voices to the individual voices
  within a staff. Part (0/1) corresponds to the uppermost part, because
  parts are numbered from 0, but voices from 1. Go figure.

<b>Solo</b>
<p>
  A quick way to mute all but one voice, or unmute all voices.
