<p>This program displays and plays chords. You can
specify the
chord</p>
<ul>
<li> by entering its symbol</li>
<li> by selecting the root, type, and
inversion from the menus</li>
<li> by entering the notes of the chord as
note names or via the keyboard, or</li>
<li>by opening a MusicXML file and
stepping through it, chord by chord.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can select any MIDI instrument known to your
system (in your <i>java.home</i><span style="font-family: monospace;">/lib/audio/soundbank.gm</span>
file) to
play the notes, you can hear them in Equal Temperament or
Just Intonation, and you can tweak the tuning of each note
(in JI mode) by entering a set of integers (the frequency ratios)
or by specifying adjustments to each pitch (in cents (100ths of a
half-step)).
</p>
<p>See the "Syntax" help topic for the details of how to specify
these
values.
</p>
<p>The keyboard panel highlights the notes of the chord in red.
Clicking
on an already-highlighted key cycles through the enharmonic spellings
(Db, C#, Bx) for that key. Shift-click to remove a note from
the chord.
</p>
<p>Just above the keyboard, each note will be labeled with its
function in
the chord (R, M3, P5, etc.) as well as the integer corresponding to the
frequency of that pitch (4:5:6 for a major triad), if in JI mode.
</p>
<p>The main panel will also display the notes of the selected
chord on
a grand staff. In JI mode, the staff notes will be colored
red (sharp) or
blue (flat) according to the pitch adjustments relative to the ET
pitch.
Hover over a note with the mouse to see its MIDI note number, any pitch
bend (in cents), and the resulting frequency (in Hz).
</p>
<p>The right half of the main panel lists alternative
interpretations for
the given chord. Clicking on a chord name in that panel will
enter the
symbol and inversion into the Symbol field and display the resulting
notes.
</p>
<p>
The lower part of the right half of the main panel gives the details
of the notes which make up the chord.  For each note, it shows the
part and voice (or just a number, if not from a MusicXML file), then
the note name and octave, the cents flat or sharp, the interval relative
to the root, the factor in the ratio set (if in JI mode), and a small
graph which indicates the frequency relative to ET. The range of the
graph is plus or minus 50 cents (one quarter tone sharp or flat).
</p>
<p>Use the &lt; and &gt; buttons at the bottom right of the main window
to scroll through the
available MIDI
instruments, or select an instrument directly using the
File-&gt;Instrument
menu. I recommend the Flute sound (bank 0, program 73 on my
system)
for the purest tones.
</p>
<p>The Tick field (upper right) displays the current position in the selected
MusicXML
file
(if any) in terms of measure, beat, and tick. You can enter a
position
in the file as a set of three integers (M:B:T), or as a single integer
(ticks from the start of the file). The "tick" value
corresponds to the length of the
smallest time division (shortest note or rest) used in the file, normally.
The &lt; and &gt; buttons to the left and right of the Tick field step
through the sequence one chord at a time.
</p>
<p>
You can play a MusicXML file at any desired tempo. The Play button starts
the playback from the current Tick location. The Stop button stops playback
immediately.
The Tempo field gives the number of quarter notes per minute (approximately)
for the playback.
</p>
<p>If a given chord type has multiple tunings in the database
(such as m7),
then entering a "2", for example, in the "Tuning:" text field will
select the alternate tuning.
<p>
The "Tune to" field accepts a sequence of voice numbers and tick values that
causes the program to select the given voice at the given tick as the
voice that the chord is tuned to. If this is blank, the chords are tuned
to the lowest note in the chord, usually the bass voice. Most barbershop
songs sound best when tuned to the melody, normally in the lead voice.
For passages where the melody is in another voice, add the start tick
and new voice to the "Tune to" field.  For example:
<pre>
  (0/2) 7:1:0 (1/2)
</pre>
<p>
This says "tune to voice (0/2), a common designation for the lead voice, from
the start of the song until measure 7, beat 1; then tune to voice (1/2), a
common designation for the bass voice, until the end of the song."
