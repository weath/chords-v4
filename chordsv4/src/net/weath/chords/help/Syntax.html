<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>
  A sequence of note names (bottom to top), with optional
  octave number (C5 is middle C) and optional tuning (in cents):
</p>
<pre>
    C Eb G
    C3 Eb5-12 G
</pre>
<p>
  Also accepts a bare integer to set the octave, and
  an underscore to skip at least an octave between notes:
</p>
<pre>
    2 C _ G _ E
</pre>


<h2>Tune to:</h2>
<p>
  A sequence of space-separated items.  Each item is either a
  note specifier (see below), or a time specifier (likewise).
  A time specifier applies to the note specifier that follows it.
</p>
  
<p>
  <b>Note Specifier:</b>
</p>
<p>
    A <b>Part and Voice number</b>, in parentheses, separated by a slash.
    For example: (0/1) is the first voice in the first part, usually
    Tenor for barbershop tunes.  Parts are numbered from 0, voices
    from 1. This causes the chord to be tuned to the note being sung
    by the given voice part, and that note to be tuned relative to the
    key of the current measure.
</p><p>
    A <b>Note name</b>, like C or Eb or F#, to specify that the chord be
    tuned so that the given note has zero pitch bend (i.e., has the E.T.
    frequency).
</p><p>
    A <b>cents value</b>, a decimal number preceded by a plus or minus, to
    tune the chord root up or down the given number of cents.
</p><p>
    Or, both a note name and cents value, to tune the chord to the given
    note, plus or minus the given number of cents.
</p>
<p>
	If no tuning spec is given, each chord's root is tuned to the E.T. scale.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time Specifier:</b>
</p>
<p>
    A <b>Measure, Beat, and Tick</b> value, separated by colons.
    Example: 1:1:0 is the first beat of the first measure, with no tick offset.
    2:1:4 would be four ticks after the first beat of the second measure.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
</p>
<pre>
	(0/2) 5:1:0 (1/2) 6:3:0 Ab-12.6 7:1:0 (0/2)
</pre>
<p>
The spec above says to tune to the Lead (voice 2 of part 0) from the beginning of
the piece until beat 1 of measure 5. That chord, and all chords up until (but not
including) the one at beat 3 of measure 6, should tune to the Bass note (voice 2 of
part 1). The chord at beat 3 of measure 6 should be tuned such that the Ab (there
<i>must</i> be an Ab in the chord!) is 12.6 cents flatter than an E.T. Ab. Starting
with beat 1 of measure 7, going to the end of the piece, tune to the Lead again.
Tuning to a given voice part implies that the note sung by that voice part should
be tuned relative to the current key, and the rest of the chord should then be tuned
relative to that note.
</p>

<h2>Ratios:</h2>
<p>
  A set of integers, one per note in the chord, specifying the
  ratios of the frequencies in the chord. Separated by spaces
  or colons.
</p>
<pre>
    4:5:6:7  (a "Barbershop" seventh chord in close position, like C E G Bb)
</pre>
