Command line: 
<pre>java -jar Chords.jar [flags]... [xmlFile]</pre>
The following flags are recognized:
<pre>
  -help
  -s
  dumpProps=&lt;path&gt;
  soundbank=&lt;path&gt;
  instrument=&lt;bank&gt;,&lt;program&gt;
  delay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
  props=&lt;path&gt;
</pre>
<p>The "-s" flag makes the display "small" by omitting the keyboard,
staff, chord-name, and note-detail panels. This may be useful when
playing back MusicXML files, to reduce the required screen space.
</p>
<p>Use "dumpProps=file" to cause the program to dump the properties to
a file so you can edit them, then run with "props=file" to use your
edited properties.  This file includes the definitions and tunings
for all the chords known to this program.  You can modify the chord list
and add new chord names, but you can't add new syntax.  The parser doesn't
grok "alt", for example, and adding it to the chord list won't fix that.
</p>
<p>
The "soundbank" option allows you to override the default location of the
MIDI soundbank file. If not specified, the program looks in 
</p>
<pre>
   {java.home}/lib/audio/soundbank.gm
</pre>
<p>
The "instrument" option sets the initial MIDI instrument, in terms of
bank number and program number. This info is listed after each instrument
name in the Instrument submenu of the File menu.
</p>
<p>
The "delay" option specifies the number of milliseconds that the program
inserts between the start of the notes of a chord, giving an arpeggio-like
effect. It defaults to 250 (one quarter of a second). If you prefer no
delay, use "delay=0" on the command line, or modify the props file as
described above to change the default.
